/* 
    Every variable in JavaScript is casted automatically so any 
    operator between two variables will always give some kind of result.

        The + (addition) operator is used for both addition and concatenation of strings.

        The addition operator is used for concatenating strings to strings, 
    strings to numbers, and numbers to strings.

        JavaScript behaves differently when you are trying to combine two operands of different types. 
    The default primitive value is a string, so when you try to add a number to a string, 
    JavaScript will transform the number to a string before the concatenation.

        To subtract, multiply and divide two numbers, use the minus (-), asterisk (*) and slash (/) signs.

        JavaScript supports the modulus operator (%) which calculates the remainder of a division operation.

        JavaScript also has a Math module which contains more advanced functions:
            >    Math.abs calculates the absolute value of a number
            >    Math.exp calculates e to the power of a number
            >    Math.pow(x,y) calculates the result of x to the power of y
            >    Math.floor removes the fraction part from a number
            >    Math.random() will give a random number x where 0<=x<1
